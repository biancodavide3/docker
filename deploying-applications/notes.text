we can deploy our applications (or microservices) as single host or cluster solution
using a single host solution is not good because there is no high availability, meaning if there is a sudden spike of traffic
our server maybe can't keep up, furthermore if the server goes down for any other reason, there is no service anymore
and other downsides...
the best approach is to use a cluster solution and the most popular and used is kubernetes aka k8s which is google's container orchestrator
it is really complex to it needs its own course but the point is you can still continue to develop locally your microservices and applications
with the aid of docker and when the time comes you deploy to k8s which in return is really easy to set up in the cloud with managed solutions
