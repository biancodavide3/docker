benefits of docker include:
1) your application will work on every machine and is very to set up
2) it is easy to run multiple applications with completely different or even conflicting underlying software on the same machine
3) it is easy to remove your entire application along with all its dependencies

container vs virtual machine:
a container is a lightweight environment to run your application which uses the os of the host and therefore can start quickly
a virtual machine is an abstraction of a physical machine that has its entire os and therefore is slow to start and resource intensive

workflow:
you need to dockerize your application which is done via a DockerFile
this file contains instruction to package your application as an image which includes all the components the application need in order to run properly
(minimized os, libraries, environment, custom code...)
now that we have the image we can simply run it as a container
furthermore we can push the image to a docker registry and distribute it
